This project is a minimal Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript setup. When making changes, please only make the required modifications. Don't make extra changes unless asked

When working on Vue components, follow best practices for Vue 3. For example, omit the following imports "defineProps" and "defineEmits" as they are compiler macros and not needed in the script setup block.
